📄 Document Q-A RAG Assistant

An AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that answers questions from uploaded PDFs using LangChain, ChromaDB vector search, and Groq LLM models — with fast semantic search and accurate context-grounded answers.

🚀 Live Demo

📌 Overview

Document Q-A RAG Assistant lets users:

✔ Upload PDF documents
✔ Automatically extract text
✔ Chunk documents for efficient retrieval
✔ Embed text vectors
✔ Store and search using ChromaDB
✔ Ask questions answered using Groq LLM (context-aware)

🧠 How It Works (RAG Pipeline)

Upload PDF – User uploads file via UI

Extract Text – PDF text is parsed

Split into Chunks – Semantic chunks created

Create Embeddings – Each chunk vectorized

Vector Store – Stored in ChromaDB

Query & Retrieve – Most relevant chunks found

LLM Generation – LLM generates accurate answers

This reduces hallucination and ensures answers use source document content.

📸 Example Results

An example UI might look like:

📥 Upload your PDF here...
-------------------------
| Choose File |  Submit |
-------------------------
Ask a question:
> What is the main topic of this PDF?

Output:

📌 Answer:
The document discusses [... extracted from context …]

🛠️ Requirements

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Add environment variable (example for Groq API key):

export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"

(Windows use set instead of export)

🚀 Run the App (Local)
streamlit run app.py

Open in browser:

http://localhost:8501
📍 Dependency Example (requirements.txt)
streamlit
langchain
chromadb
groq
openai
pypdf
tiktoken

(Add specific versions if needed)

🧪 Example Use Case

Upload a research paper PDF, then ask:

Q: What are the key conclusions of the paper?

📌 The app retrieves the most relevant text and generates detailed answers based on document context, not internet knowledge alone.
